This program is used to automate product label/sign marking by creating 2D drawing
files in the .dxf format. The input data is read from a excel input file. The
data can be displayed as a text, a QR code or a combination of the options.

User can enter desired size of a single sign as well as the size of the sheets
the signs will be marked on and the program will automatically fit the data on
the sheets. Each sheet (=file) can have multiple layers of signs.
